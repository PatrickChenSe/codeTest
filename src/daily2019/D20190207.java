/*
Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] rotated by two becomes [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2].
Try solving this without creating a copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?

@Facebook
@array
@rotate

不创建额外的array的话，肯定要用length次吧?  len-k move up,  k swap to end, total len times
how? 写代码证明
