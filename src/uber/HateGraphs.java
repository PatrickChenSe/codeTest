/*
You are given a list of species numbered 1 to n. You have two arrays a and b. For all i, a[i] and b[i] hate each other. Find the number of ways you can keep these species in enclosures such that no pair of species who hate each other are in the same enclosure.

Example:

Input: n = 3, a = [1, 2] b = [2, 3]
Output: 4
Explanation: {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,3} are the possible groups into which you can divide the species. Each bracket here represents a separate enclosure.
