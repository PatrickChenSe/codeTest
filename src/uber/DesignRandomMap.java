/*
Design a map that supports all following operations in average O(1) time:

class RandomMap {
	void put(int key, int value);
	Integer get(int key);
	Integer getRandom(); // this should return a random value with equal probability
	void remove(int key);
}
The question is similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1 but in this case it's a map instead of a set which makes things slightly more complicated.
