For i = 0, we wouldâ€™ve picked uniformly from [0, 0].
For i > 0, before the loop began, any element K in [0, i - 1] had 1 / i chance
of being chosen as the random element. We want K to have 1 / (i + 1) chance
of being chosen after the iteration. This is the case since the chance of having
being chosen already but not getting swapped with the ith element is
1 / i * (1 - (1 / (i + 1))) which is 1 / i * i / (i + 1) or 1 / (i + 1)
