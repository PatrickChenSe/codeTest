/*
You are given two natural numbers n and x.
You are required to create an array of n natural numbers such that the bitwise XOR of the numbers is equal to x.
The sum of all the natural numbers that are available in the array is as minimum as possible.
If their exists multiple arrays, then output the one that is the smallest among them.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, x = 2
Output: [1, 1, 2]
Constraints:

1<= n <=10^5
1<= x <=10^18
