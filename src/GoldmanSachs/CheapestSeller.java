Assume there are many sellers and you have to find the cheapest price at any one time.
 The beginning and ending time/date will be given for each scenario and the goal is to have an algorithm that can generate the cheapest price a seller is offering.
 So for example:
 For the dates of 1-3 Jan and 2-5 Jan
 Find out the cheapest price the seller is giving between those dates
