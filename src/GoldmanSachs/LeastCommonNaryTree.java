LCA for general or n-ary trees (Sparse Matrix DP approach < O(nlogn), O(logn)>)
In previous posts, we have discussed how to calculate the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
for a binary tree and a binary search tree (this, this and this). Now let’s look at a method that can
 calculate LCA for any tree (not only for binary tree). We use Dynamic Programming with Sparse Matrix Approach in our method.
  This method is very handy and fast when you need to answer multiple queries of LCA for a tree.

solution:
Pre-requisites : –
1) DFS
2) Basic DP knowledge (This and this)
3) Range Minimum Query (Square Root Decomposition and Sparse Table)
