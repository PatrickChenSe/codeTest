 1. Given sequence on integers and asked to find the second lowest integer
 2. Calculate median of two sequences of numbers
    a. Some codes were provided with test cases, was asked to add more and code then test them with function to see if all test cases passed.
 3. Implement hashmap
 4. Given a chessboard with a piece on it, need to calculate the number of possible # moves, and probability of the piece remaining on the board within "n" number of steps
 5. Implement a Quicksort
 6. You have a big file system – how would you store the directory (data structure questions), what is the most efficient way to do it
 7. Staircase – 1 step, 2 step or 3 steps – what are the Permutation to get out of that
 8. Is this number a power of 10? They run a sequence of numbers; asked to write a solution that tests whether that number is a power of 10
 9. How many pairs of numbers are in the list which equal the sum? They run a series of numbers with a sum at the end, you’re then asked to develop a solution which finds how many pairs of numbers are in the list which equal the sum.
 10. Go through a string and find the first non-duplicate letter
 11. Multi-threading question
 12. Given 2 views of data and asked to construct project architecture. During this scenario, she was asked more questions about decisions she made and if substitutions could be made if one aspect of the code was absent.
 13. To implement a release and pretend that it currently does not exist in JVM. She provided 3 different solutions and was asked about the pros and cons of each.
 14. Based on the provided number, find all of its prime factors (when the factors are multiplied, they should result in the original number)
 15. Given an array, find a subarray such the sum of the elements in subarray is greater than or equal to target value. Find the minimum length of such subarray.
 16. Dot product of two metrices. Was asked to write test cases. Find all prime factors of number such that their products are the number itself. (Test were already written)
 17. Calculate the N’th Fibonacci number.
 18. There is robot who can traverse from one point to another given a path to traverse, So the robot can only traverse in four direction UP, DOWN , RIGHT, LEFT represented by 'U' , 'D', 'R' ,'L' respectively. and ignore all other command.
  so given a path and initial  co-ordinate you have to evaluate the destination co-ordinate.
 source path(0,0) -> string path given{Up Down Right Left LL ll dd} - > Targeted path(-2,0)

 19. So there is miner at point A and he heard about some rare rock in point B so he decided to do a road trip from point A to point B and decided to collect as many of all the types of rock along the way.
 A = {{2, 3, 1}, End point
 {3, 1, 1},
 {2, 3, 1}}
 start point
 (The only restriction is you can either go UP or RIGHT.)

 20. Test if a given number (X) is to the power of 10. Not 10 to the power of X. (Candidates tend to get confused. If you encounter this question, best to clarify if the wording of the question isn’t straight-forward)
 21. Prime factorization of a list of numbers. (It’s has been mathematical proven by a mathematician that any number can be broken down into factors of prime number. For e.g. 12 - 2x2x3)
 (The software that he was supposed to come up with must be able to give the final answer of the number and not just one prime factor)

 22. Assume there are many sellers and you have to find the cheapest price at any one time.
 The beginning and ending time/date will be given for each scenario and the goal is to have an algorithm that can generate the cheapest price a seller is offering.
 So for example:
 For the dates of 1-3 Jan and 2-5 Jan
 Find out the cheapest price the seller is giving between those dates

 23. Given a span of text, find the shortest distance between certain two words. Codes and 6 test cases given, Find bugs in the codes and fix bugs to pass test cases.
 24. The 1st question is Fibonacci. main function is finished, but when the parameter is 40 the result is very large and the CPU is out of usage. should change the return form int to long is ok
 25. Given data structure [[“A”, “87”], [“B”, “100”], [“C”, “50”], [“B”, “50”]], calculate the best average score.

 26. Given a list of segments (Where a segment is a line with a start Point & an endpoint), sort these segments to form a continuous Path.
 e.g. [(2,1),(1,4),(3,2)] should be returned as [(3,2),(2,1),(1,4)].
 Assume that there are no 2 segments with the same start point. Also assume that there are no 2 segments which cover the same segment in opposite directions e.g (1,2) & (2,1)

 27. Fibonacci in non-recursive manner with O(n) and space O(1). Tests already written.
 28. Given a student array with names and avg. Find best average. Tests already written.
 studentsArray[][] = {
 [S1, 3]
 [S2, 4]
 [S1, 2]
 ..
 }
 29. Can you implement atoi function, input string “42”, return int 42”.
 30. Interviewer copied a function code and unit test. Then asked “What do you think about this unit test?”, “Can you fix this unit test?” (After fixing the unit test, found that the function is wrong – it was to implement a parseInt (pronounced as par-sient) function.)
 31. replace repeating characters from the beginning
    for example:  ABCABCD = ABC*D
