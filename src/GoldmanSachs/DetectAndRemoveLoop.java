Write a function detectAndRemoveLoop() that checks whether a given Linked List contains loop and if loop is present
then removes the loop and returns true. And if the list doesnâ€™t contain loop then returns false.
Below diagram shows a linked list with a loop. detectAndRemoveLoop() must change the below list to 1->2->3->4->5->NULL.

    Distance traveled by fast pointer = 2 * (Distance traveled

(m + n*x + k) = 2*(m + n*y + k)

Note that before meeting the point shown above, fast
was moving at twice speed.

x -->  Number of complete cyclic rounds made by
       fast pointer before they meet first time

y -->  Number of complete cyclic rounds made by
       slow pointer before they meet first time

    m + k = (x-2y)*n

Which means m+k is a multiple of n.

So if we start moving both pointers again at same speed such that one pointer (say slow) begins from head node of
linked list and other pointer (say fast) begins from meeting point. When slow pointer reaches beginning of loop
(has made m steps), fast pointer would have made also moved m steps as they are now moving same pace.
 Since m+k is a multiple of n and fast starts from k, they would meet at the beginning.
Can they meet before also? No because slow pointer enters the cycle first time after m steps.
