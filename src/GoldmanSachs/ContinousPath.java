Given a list of segments (Where a segment is a line with a start Point & an endpoint),
sort these segments to form a continuous Path.
 e.g. [(2,1),(1,4),(3,2)] should be returned as [(3,2),(2,1),(1,4)].
 Assume that there are no 2 segments with the same start point. Also assume that there are no 2 segments
 which cover the same segment in opposite directions e.g (1,2) & (2,1)

think: i,j;   i, i+1, i+1, i+n, i+n ... j
it's a question about sort
