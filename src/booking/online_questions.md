1. 2- (Coding test at hackerrank) You have a list of words and  a list of hotel reviews, try to sort the hotels based on the number of words from the first list that is exist in the each review. if an hotel has maximum number of 4 words then it should be the highest in the sorting
Given a string of parentheses, check if the parentheses are balanced. Then the question was extended to all types of brackets
这个都可以通过Daily20181031, D20190223解决   

2. What a fibonacci function which return N th position number both in recursive and loop, also give the explanation on both implementation on their time efficiency

3. What is HashMap ? Give the comparison on HashMap and TreeMap, that is the efficiency on their intersection and traverse.  

4. input interger 1234, return "1234" in string or characters 

5. Find Nth nearest neighbours in a graph.

6. shift an array to the right by n positions such that the right most indexes are become the first ones and the first ones move ahead.
   like:
   1 2 3 4 5 --> shift by 2 --> 4 5 1 2 3
   这里有两种，一种是Linkedlist, 一种是array
   array在这里，D20190207， 两种方式，一种是利用额外空间, O(n), O(n), 还有一种是reverse，3次即可(O(2n) -> O(n))
7. Union of n arrays with x elements. Output common members contained in at least 2 arrays. Explain the complexity of the algorithm used
8. Given any number of arrays containing numbers, write a function which
   finds the numbers that appear in exactly two arrays.
   
   arrays = [
       [6, 2, 2, 0, 4],
       [5, 0, 2, 6, 7, 1],
       [6, 7, 9, 9],
   ]
   find_in_two(arrays) should return [2, 0, 7]  
9. Find how many moves it takes from point A in a maze to point B.  
10. Finding the knights tour on a chess board ?  
11. Can be solved by using sliding window technique or tries.  
12. Stack implementation
13. Given an array of words as NSStrings you should return another array of NSStrings, each containing words that are mutual anagrams  
14. Count number of islands in a matrix.  
15. the longest sequence in array (a,a+1,a+2,...)
16. Given a string of characters, find the maximum substring with no repetitions.
