Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

+---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:

+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+


自己想的，用DATA_ADD方法
select w2.id as Id from Weather w1, Weather w2
 where w1.RecordDate = DATE(DATE_ADD(w2.RecordDate, INTERVAL -1 DAY)) and w2.Temperature > w1.Temperature;


solution:
SELECT
    weather.id AS 'Id'
FROM
    weather
        JOIN
    weather w ON DATEDIFF(weather.date, w.date) = 1
        AND weather.Temperature > w.Temperature
;

solution的更快

DATA_ADD 和 DATADIFF方法
